Simple Shopping App

DataModel contains all the data (in array, global variable)
Using MCV pattern
2 views using TabBar, for Home and Category
When adding to shopping cart, data is stored to shoppingCart array, indexing using the ProductID
When checking out, will empty the shoppingCart array

Search, category view (should be the same logic as search), adding promotion items, and variant selector will be a future progress

It is very simple indeed but I had fun creating it :)
